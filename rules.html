            Mini-Cryptex 2020 will be a 24 hour-long event and will start at 6:30 PM on the 21st of November 2020 and end on the 22nd of November 2020, 6:30 PM, exclusively for the newest members of IIT H.
          </li>
          <li>
            This mini-Cryptex consists of 8 levels of gradually increasing difficulty. You will receive successive questions upon solving and entering the answer of each level.
          </li>
          <li>
            The winner will be the first person to complete all the levels. In case no one completes the event before 22nd November 2020 1830 IST, the person occupying the first position on the leaderboard will be declared the winner.

          </li>
          <li>
            The competition is open only to the freshers’ of IITH.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will provide a platform to communicate with the moderators and ask for hints. Using any other platform to disclose questions/solutions will result in instant disqualification.
          </li>
          <li>
            The answers should be typed completely in lowercase, without any spaces, punctuation, special characters or numerals. The only exception to this is when the answer is a numeral greater than 1000 or when the answer is a special character.
          </li>
          <li>
            The questions may also involve interacting with the page itself, following hyperlinks etc. Nothing is as it seems. EVERYTHING is a clue.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any attempt to access levels you have not yet reached or any form of attack on the servers will result in immediate disqualification.
          </li>
          <li>
            The organizer’s decision is final in any case.
          </li>
          <li>
            And last but not the least, the most important rule: have fun, make friends, and wreck your brain!
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>(P.S. We know we said this ain’t a team event, but hey, what fun are rules if they’re never broken? ;) )</p>

            Google is your friend. Usually. You’re expected to use Google and other online tools in your quest to crack Cryptex. Do keep in mind that Google may give you erroneous results in certain cases.
          </li>
          <li>
             Reverse searching images might help you in certain cases. Chrome extensions like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/huntress-reverse-image-se/nkhjamjppefmeceaokadfacbdmmcmdpg?hl=en">Huntress</a>/<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lightshot/">Lightshot</a> might be handy.
          </li>
          <li>
             The questions are open-ended, may have red herrings, cheeky hints and may lead you on wild goose chases. If you are getting nowhere with a certain approach, do consider that you might be on the wrong train of thought.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the other hand, it could be that the answer is ‘colour’ when you
            have been trying ‘color’. Check for alternate spelling, names and
            other such variations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clues might be hidden (especially in the first few questions) to
            reduce wrong trains of attack. Their absence, however, does not
            indicate anything.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hints to the questions will be released on the forum based on certain factors. The hints and even the titles of the question may not have any apparent meaning until you figure out the answer and/or receive another part of the clue.
          </li>
          <li>
            The forum is the quickest way to reach the moderators of Cryptex. You may ask for hints on the forum.
          </li>
          <li>
             The questions might involve simple cryptography, wordplay, steganography, conventional puzzles or maybe simple connect questions. However each of them is designed to be solved in a reasonable amount of time with access to just internet and pen and paper.
